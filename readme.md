## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app or any additional context you'd like to add.
    - transfering the id of a selected user to viewcreator page in order to show his information. 
    solved by using useParams() from react-router-dom
    -overall it was an easy task for me as i have gained a little bit of experience building full stack applications
